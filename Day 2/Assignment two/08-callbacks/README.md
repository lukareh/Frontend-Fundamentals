Callbacks

Concepts
- Callback functions
- Asynchronous programming
- setTimeout

Assignments

Callback with Delay
Create a function that accepts a callback and executes it after 10 seconds.

Run: node callback-example.js

Note: The program will wait for 10 seconds before executing the callback functions. This demonstrates asynchronous programming in JavaScript.

What is a Callback?

A callback is a function passed as an argument to another function, which is then invoked inside the outer function to complete some kind of routine or action.

Callbacks are commonly used for:
- Asynchronous operations
- Event handling
- Array methods (map, filter, forEach)
- Timers (setTimeout, setInterval)
