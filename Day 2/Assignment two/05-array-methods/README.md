Array Methods (Important)

Concepts
- map() - Transform array elements
- filter() - Select elements based on condition
- reduce() - Reduce array to single value

Assignments

All array operations are demonstrated in a single file:

Run: node array-operations.js

Operations performed:

2. Use filter to find numbers greater than 10
3. Use reduce to find the sum of array elements
4. Reverse an array
